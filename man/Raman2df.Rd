\title{Import Renishaw Raman spectra files (ASCII)}
\usage{
Raman2df(datafilename)
}
\arguments{
\item{datafilename}{text string with full path to experimental file}
}
\value{
Dataframe with the following columns (and no extra attributes):
   $ sampleid        : char
   $ wavenum         : numeric
   $ counts          : numeric
   $ wnum.interp     : interpolated wavenumber vector (equidistant)
   $ cts.interp      : interpolated counts vector
}
\description{
Reads Raman (ASCII) datafile and returns a dataframe with the original data,
as well as interpolated wavenumber and counts values
(interpolated data is evenly spaced along x-axis, required for later peak fitting
with diffractometry package).
